This is my first time writing a blog. I want to write about some projects that I'm working on, but also some of the things I learn along the way. I have about 8 years' experience in software engineering, and I would like to share my journey with everyone.

I've been diving into indie hacking recently, and I think it's a great idea to "build in public." I will be sharing my blog posts here, YouTube videos, TikToks, and tweets. I hope you have a great time reading my story. If you want to comment on something I wrote or have a discussion, feel free to email me. ðŸ˜„
